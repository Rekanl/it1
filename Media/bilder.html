            <h3>JPEG/JFIF</h3>

            <p>
                JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a lossy compression method; JPEG-compressed images are usually
                stored in the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF filename extension is JPG or
                JPEG.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, which supports eight-bit
                grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue). JPEG applies lossy
                compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Applications can
                determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of
                the result. When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's
                quality, but JPEG files suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved. (JPEG also
                provides lossless image storage, but the lossless version is not widely supported.)
            </p>

            <h3>JPEG 2000</h3>
            JPEG 2000 is a compression standard enabling both lossless and lossy storage. The compression methods used
            are different from the ones in standard JFIF/JPEG; they improve quality and compression ratios, but also
            require more computational power to process. JPEG 2000 also adds features that are missing in JPEG. It is
            not nearly as common as JPEG, but it is used currently in professional movie editing and distribution (some
            digital cinemas, for example, use JPEG 2000 for individual movie frames).
